                <strong>WARNING</strong> This site is alive.
                Software is a living thing that is never finished.
            </p>
            <p>
                So is this website.
                Maybe this website is even more alive than most things.
            </p>
            <p>
                It will change from visit to visit.
                And maybe it will even change during your visit.
                Actually, we hope it will.

        <h1>We build software things</h1>
        <p>
            We are a full-stack software consultancy.
        </p>
        <p>
            You hire us to build the first version of your new project or to help you with development on your current project.
        </p>
        <p>
            You hire us when you have a project idea, and you want to verify your assumptions as quickly as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you have an idea but need to figure out how to approach it.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you have an existing project and a lot of feature requests, and you don't know where to start.
        </p>
        <p>
            We specialize in full-stack solutions, most often with a web-based interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            We take care of architecture, advise you on and assist you with hosting.
        </p>
        <p>
            We help you to figure out how to best approach your project, making sure you get the most value as quickly as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            You own the source code of everything we build.
            Once we hand off the project you don't have to rely on us for changes.
        </p>
