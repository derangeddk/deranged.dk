                It's hard to find the kind of person who can see the big picture of your business,
                and make the right technical decisions to support it. Even if you have a great CTO,
                they will quickly get too many tasks for each day. That leads to high-level technical
                decision making and direction setting becoming a bottleneck.

                Our consultants take on that exact perspective, to take on the role as
                temporary CTO if you don't have one, or the role of directly supporting your CTO in

                Senior developers are few and far between. That makes it difficult to train junior developers and build a highly competent software development team that takes responsibility and delivers consistently. To make matters worse, if developers don't feel like they are learning and growing, they often leave for other companies.
