                        We were hired by <strong>MarMar Copenhagen</strong> to modernize their webshop, as the existing shop was aging and hard to
                        maintain. Especially the work required to upload new products and handle orders was a problem.
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        MarMar's needs were for a typical webshop, so we suggested using a standard (best in class)
                        piece of software for the shop, and focus on processes and integrations. We landed on Shopify as
                        the core webshop product.

                        <li>
                            We integrated two webshops (for different markets) with Marmar's logistics partner and their
                            accounting system, allowing most orders to be fully processed without need for employee
                            interaction. For edge cases, we implemented a reporting interface, supporting Marmar staff in
                            figuring out what might have gone wrong with orders and fix the issues.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We focused on employee education, making sure that key employees could solve issues as they
                            occur. Additionally we trained employees to make advanced changes to the Shopify store, freeing
                            them from the need to communicate with and pay an external contractor for changes to the
                            webshop's look and content.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The project resulted in a manifold increase in sales from webshop and significantly reduced
                            workload required to handle orders and upload products.
                        </li>

                            We also coordinated between several of Marmar's other suppliers and were instrumental in
                            ensuring the success of a migration of a logistics integration for the entire business (both B2B
                            and webshop).

                        <strong>Fischer Lighting</strong> had a custom legacy software system used for running several business critical functions that was causing
                        problems, and needed replacing.
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        We planned the replacement to be gradual and stable. We decided not to build and design a large
                        and complex system to be launched all at once, as this would lead to significant confusion among
                        users and potentially inhibit adoption. Additionally, such an approach is error prone as the
                        complexity of systems grows exponentially with size: bugs would be more likely, and we would be
                        less likely to have designed good user interactions for all use cases. Instead, we implemented a
                        new system, integrating with the legacy system, replacing one part at a time. This allowed users
                        to get used to the new system in manageable increments, while minimizing disruption to
                        established work processes.

                            We performed an analysis of people and work processes involved in the tasks supported by the
                            legacy system, which identified bottlenecks in communication and coordination, as well as
                            providing a more thorough understanding of the work the legacy system was supporting. This
                            allowed us to design a new system that would more comprehensibly automate easily automatable
                            tasks and better support human decision making and creative processes.

                            Throughout, we have analyzed and recommended the highest impact improvements, e.g. the ones
                            where most value would result from the smallest investment. We continuously interact with users,
                            working to understand how the software has changed their work processes, needs and interactions.
                            This has allowed us to continue to improve user interaction with our system and support more and
                            more of the work in the company.

                            We have integrated with various of Fischer Lighting's other suppliers and tools, and built
                            custom support for supply handling and planning of complex and interdependent products; advanced
                            requirements specification of Fischer Lighting's customers' needs; project planning and
                            execution; and report generation with advanced calculations. We have migrated data from a
                            complex legacy system, and launched a new system that significantly saves employee work time,
                            freeing up time for more important tasks.
