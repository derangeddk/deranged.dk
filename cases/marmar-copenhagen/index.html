  About MarMar Copenhagen

            <li>
                MarMar's needs were for a typical webshop, so we suggested using a standard (best in class)
                piece of software for the shop, and focus on processes and integrations. We landed on Shopify as
                the core webshop product.
            </li>
            <li>
                We integrated two webshops (for different markets) with Marmar's logistics partner and their
                accounting system, allowing most orders to be fully processed without need for employee
                interaction. For edge cases, we implemented a reporting interface, supporting Marmar staff in
                figuring out what might have gone wrong with orders and fix the issues.
            </li>
            <li>
                We focused on employee education, making sure that key employees could solve issues as they
                occur. Additionally we trained employees to make advanced changes to the Shopify store, freeing
                them from the need to communicate with and pay an external contractor for changes to the
                webshop's look and content.
            </li>
            <li>
                The project resulted in a manifold increase in sales from webshop and significantly reduced
                workload required to handle orders and upload products.
            </li>
            <li>
                We also coordinated between several of Marmar's other suppliers and were instrumental in
                ensuring the success of a migration of a logistics integration for the entire business (both B2B
                and webshop).
