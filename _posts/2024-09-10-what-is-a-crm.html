    Streamline Customer Relationships, Enhance Sales, and Drive Growth with the
    Right CRM
  </p>
  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>
    From humble beginnings in the Rolodexes of the 1980s and spreadsheets of the
    1990s and 2000’s through to the advanced automation, AI and analytics of
    modern CRM systems, CRM systems have always been important for businesses
    interested in growing, managing and retaining their customer base.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite CRM software having been around for decades, not all businesses make
    use of one. Instead, many often keep vital information, like customer
    details, stored across scattered spreadsheets, wallets full of business
    cards, and scraps of paper - these inefficient methods are incredibly
    difficult to share with a team. If this is you (or you’re just interested in
    implementing a CRM) then read on!
  </p>
  <h2>Understanding CRM Systems</h2>
  <p>
    At its heart, a CRM system is a piece of software used to manage your
    business's customer relationships. From simple-to-use full spectrum
    solutions like <a href="/hubspot">HubSpot</a> to dedicated sales & marketing
    solutions like <a href="/pipedrive">Pipedrive</a>, through to enterprise
    software solutions like Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics 365, there is a
    CRM solution for every type of business.
  </p>
  <p>
    What a CRM system isn’t is a silver bullet. Implementing one will not
    magically get you sales, nor double your contract sizes. But what it will do
    is help your company to streamline your business processes, align
    departments such as sales, marketing and customer service and allow you to
    be systematic in your approach towards reaching out to prospective clients,
    which in turn helps you make more outreach and convert more sales with the
    help of tools like automations.
  </p>
  <h2>Key Features of a CRM System</h2>
  <p>
    Modern CRM systems offer a broad range features, but some common components
    you can expect to be included are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Lead Management: Potential customers can be added to the system as leads.
      You can differentiate between types of leads to evaluate where your
      customers are coming from.
    </li>
    <li>
      Sales Pipelines: Allows you to define (and understand) the stages that
      your customers go through before buying from you and gives you a visual
      oversight of your entire sales process.
    </li>
    <li>
      Reports and Forecasting: As you add more data to your CRM, reports will
      help you understand your business and identify trends, allowing you to
      focus on the right types of customers. Forecasting helps you determine
      where your business will realistically be in the future.
    </li>
    <li>
      Automation: Business process automations can help speed up processes, such
      as email outreach, saving your organisation time and enabling you to scale
      your business as fewer hands are required on deck to achieve the same
      results.
    </li>
    <li>
      Invoicing and proposals: Create, draft and send Invoices and proposals to
      your clients and prospects.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Depending on your needs you can look to consolidate all of this information
    in one centralised location, instead of building a large tech stack to gain
    the same functionality, or you can look at separate systems, in a “best in
    class” type scenario and add features as you require them, just ensure that
    these applications can talk to one another. This can easily be done with
    automation systems like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> where you
    can build automated workflows between over 7000 different apps.
  </p>
  <h2>Why Does Your Business Need a CRM?</h2>
  <p>
    Managing your customer relationships via spreadsheet is no longer sufficient
    and there are many reasons why you’d want to implement a CRM, some of which
    we’ve listed below:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You’re looking to centralise your customer information - This ensures that
      your entire team has access to up-to-date and accurate information about
      your clients.
    </li>
    <li>
      You want to fortify your customer relationships - You can track every
      interaction a customer has with your business, allowing you to understand
      their needs and preferences better. This information ultimately helps you
      to tailor your communications and offers, leading to stronger, more
      personal relationships with customers.
    </li>
    <li>
      You want to improve your sales - A CRM provides your organisation with the
      tools needed to manage and streamline sales processes. You can easily
      scale your sales by increasing outreach without necessarily adding and
      ensuring that no potential sale falls through the cracks. If a sales
      person leaves your organisation it is no longer the death knell for
      interactions with the customers they have converted.
    </li>
    <li>
      You want to boost productivity - Routine tasks such as follow-up emails,
      meeting scheduling, and data entry can be automated. This frees up your
      team, no matter the size, to be able to focus on what’s important. Company
      wide email templates help ensure consistency in your sales and marketing
      efforts and are available across your teams.
    </li>
    <li>
      You want to gain actionable insights into your customers - Modern CRMs
      come equipped with powerful analytics and reporting tools. By analyzing
      data from your CRM, you can gain valuable insights into your sales
      performance, customer behavior, and marketing effectiveness. These
      insights enable you to make informed decisions, identify areas for
      improvement, and refine your business strategies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Enhance Collaboration Across Teams - A CRM fosters collaboration by
      providing a single platform where different departments can access and
      update customer information. Whether it's sales, marketing, or customer
      service, everyone can work together seamlessly, ensuring a consistent and
      coordinated approach to customer engagement.
    </li>
    <li>
      Support Scalability - As your business grows, so does the complexity of
      managing customer relationships. A CRM system is designed to scale with
      your business. It can handle an increasing volume of data, support more
      users, and integrate with other tools and systems you might adopt in the
      future.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Implementing a CRM system is a strategic investment that can significantly
    impact your business's growth and success. By centralising customer
    information, enhancing relationships, improving sales management, and
    providing valuable insights, a CRM positions your business for sustainable
    growth.
