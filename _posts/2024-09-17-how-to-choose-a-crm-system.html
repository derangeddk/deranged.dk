    A guide to selecting the right CRM option for your business.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this guide, we delve into our process for narrowing down which CRM
    (Customer Relationship Management) system your organisation should choose.
  </p>
  <h2>How do I know if my company needs a CRM?</h2>
  <p>
    As your company grows, bottlenecks and so called 'pain points' start to
    appear. Have you identified any of the following in your business?
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Falling behind in generating leads and making sales outreach?</li>
    <li>Difficulty accessing and organising your customer data?</li>
    <li>Lack of visibility into sales team activities?</li>
    <li>Issues managing customer accounts effectively?</li>
    <li>Spending too much time creating reports?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you’ve answered yes to any of the above then in our opinion implementing
    a CRM system would have immediate benefits for your organisation.
  </p>
  <h2>What should a company prioritise when choosing a CRM solution</h2>
  <p>
    So you’ve already learned about
    <a href="2024-09-10-what-is-a-crm">what a CRM is</a>, and identified a need
    for one, however, given the countless options available - from simple,
    affordable solutions for small businesses to enterprise-level platforms
    designed for international teams - finding the right one can be
    overwhelming. So how do you identify which system is the best fit for your
    company?
  </p>
  <p>
    The next step in our process is to identify what concrete problems you are
    looking to solve with a CRM system. Let’s take an example - you want to be
    able to track and manage leads efficiently.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a CRM all the lead data you have is stored in one location, and can be
    presented in a visual kanban style sales pipeline. With this you can
    immediately get an overview of how many leads are in your system, where they
    are in the sales pipeline, what interactions have taken place and the status
    of the lead.
  </p>
  <p>For example, you can:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Track interactions: Every call, email or meeting is logged, and you can
      see when no action has been taken, or when follow ups are scheduled.
    </li>
    <li>
      Lead prioritisation: You can assign a prioritisation level to leads -
      follow up on the most valuable leads for your company first.
    </li>
    <li>
      Automate routine tasks: Task reminders, follow-up emails and more can be
      automated, so you and your team can focus on high-value work, like
      personalised outreach, customer retention and meetings with potential
      clients rather than repetitive tasks.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    A CRM would help resolve this issue, albeit it's an issue that most CRM
    systems can help with, so a narrowing down is required and there are several
    factors to consider.
  </p>
  <h2>Factors for choosing a CRM system</h2>
  <p>
    The following six factors should help you narrow down your choices - we
    break them down below.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#budget">Budget</a></li>
    <li><a href="#features">Features</a></li>
    <li><a href="#scalability">Scalability</a></li>
    <li><a href="#integrationCapabilities">Integration Capabilities</a></li>
    <li><a href="#easOfUse">Ease of Use</a></li>
    <li><a href="#customoreSupport">Customer Support</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p id="budget">
    <strong>Budget</strong>: Determine your monthly budget for a CRM system -
    there are options available in every price bracket. Most vendors operate on
    a per user, per month basis and offer discounts if accounts are paid for
    annually.
  </p>
  <p>
    Several CRM vendors offer free accounts with limited features, these are
    ideal for dipping your toes into the water and getting an idea of the
    system’s layout and features, while also actually beginning to use their
    features at zero cost. These are great for single users and can be scaled at
    a later date. These include
    <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/">HubSpot</a> and
    <a href="https://www.odoo.com/">Odoo</a>. If you’re in a low budget or no
    budget situation these are our recommendations. You can migrate if your
    needs change or scale within the systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Several other vendors offer free trials, including
    <a
      href="https://app.pipedrive.com/affiliate/pdp-deranged-aps?utm_content=copy_text&utm_medium[%E2%80%A6]_program&utm_source=deranged%20ApS&utm_term=pdp-deranged-aps"
      >Pipedrive</a
    >, <a href="http://Monday.com">Monday.com</a>,
    <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/"
      >Microsoft Dynamics</a
    >
    and <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a>. These trials are a
    good way to get hands-on experience with a CRM, explore features, and get
    deep insights into functionality. A sales specific CRM like Pipedrive is a
    good bet if you have some budget and need an effective feature packed system
    that you want to start using straight away.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whatever choice you are leaning towards, from free basic versions to premium
    solutions with advanced features, remember that although the price per user
    may initially seem steep for some options, when you factor in the revenue
    generation potential of improving your sales processes and retaining
    pre-existing clients, these systems will pay for themselves with some
    caveats.
  </p>
  <p id="features">
    <strong>Features</strong>: You need to determine whether you are looking for
    a dedicated sales CRM that is feature rich but with a laser focus on sales,
    or a broad spectrum solution that encompasses sales, marketing and more.
    Keep an eye out for CRM essential features like workflow and sales
    automations - these will save you time in the long run.
  </p>
  <h3>Dedicated vs Integrated platform</h3>
  <p>
    Identify the specific needs of your business. Do you need a CRM for sales,
    marketing, customer service, or a combination of these? Make sure the CRM
    you choose aligns with your requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are broadly two types of CRM systems, dedicated or integrated. Below
    we detail some of the rationale behind choosing each type of solution.
  </p>
  <p>
    The reasons why you’d want a dedicated solution, like Pipedrive or
    <a href="https://www.close.com/">Close</a>, are numerous.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you already have preferred software that you want to use in your tech
    stack for marketing, content creation etc these focused solutions may be the
    way to go. If you’re only setting up a sales pipeline the cost
    effectiveness, and simplicity of training are also big ticks in these
    systems boxes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dedicated solutions tend to be very well integrated into the tech ecosystem,
    given that they are designed to operate as part of your tech stack. We
    recommend focusing on dedicated solutions if you are looking to get
    processes up and running quickly, have a single use case for a CRM or have a
    pre-existing tech stack that you aren’t currently looking to move away from.
  </p>
  <p>
    Conversely choosing an integrated solution that covers multiple business
    needs, like HubSpot, can give you a single integrated platform that covers
    many of your businesses needs under one roof. HubSpot, for example, consists
    of several “hubs” each aligning with a different part of your sales process,
    from lead prospecting through to customer service.
  </p>
  <p>
    Integrated platforms further centralise your customer data and give you a
    holistic overview of your customer journey. One thing to note is that
    integrated platforms can carry initially higher costs due to the broad scope
    of their platform in comparison to dedicated platforms. We recommend looking
    at integrated systems if you have a budget, and are looking to cover more
    than one department's needs.
  </p>
  <p id="scalability">
    <strong>Scalability</strong>: Both dedicated and Integrated platforms can
    scale with your company. You can add functionality via tiered pricing
    structures, and expand your teams by adding “seats” or “users”. This gives
    you a standardised monthly cost increase for maintaining your CRM system
    when you add additional team members.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most CRMs offer multi user access to the same sales pipelines, meaning that
    teams can easily cooperate. We recommend that you investigate the costs of
    scaling before committing to a CRM, adding users and functionality can add
    up quickly.
  </p>
  <p id="integrationCapabilities">
    <strong>Integration Capabilities</strong>: If you’re leaning towards a dedicated CRM
    platform, then this is especially important. Ensuring that the CRM can
    integrate with the other tools and systems you use, such as email platforms,
    marketing automation tools, and e-commerce systems can be done easily. CRM
    vendors have “marketplaces”, where you can align your tech stacks, for
    example Pipedrive integrates with over 400 other applications, details of
    which you can find
    <a href="https://www.pipedrive.com/en/marketplace">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A quick search for the CRM title and “Integrations” should help you find
    your way to the CRM vendors marketplace.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some essential integrations we recommend checking for are your
    organisation's email provider, Automation tool
    <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>, your company's calendar app,
    Social media channels your company uses and your chosen billing application.
  </p>
  <p id="easOfUse">
    <strong>Ease of Use</strong>: Often overlooked, but you should select a CRM
    that is user friendly and intuitive. If it's too complicated, your team
    might not use it effectively, negating its benefits. Even when leaning
    towards an integrated solution our recommendation is to start with mastering
    one aspect of it and grow your use of the system from there.
  </p>
  <p>
    Several vendors offer free certifications that can help guide you in the
    right direction. Remember a CRM system is only as good as the training your
    team has to use it. Without training many of the core functions will go
    unused, and adoption rates will suffer. We recommend certifying your team,
    the time it takes is minimal versus the growth potential it makes possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many of the systems we’ve already mentioned are easy to set up initially,
    but require a level of expertise to maximise their potential. Complex
    features such as data migration, if you’re migrating to a new CRM, need to
    be taken into account - you will need to match data fields which can be a
    tricky task. If a CRM is being added to your pre-existing tech stack,
    integrations will need to be set up, and in order to maximise efficiency -
    automated workflows and triggers need to be put in place. These more complex
    features can be put in place over time, but some require expert advice.
  </p>
  <p id="customoreSupport">
    <strong>Customer Support</strong>: With sometimes complex implementations
    and customisation options customer support from the vendor is essential.
    Check they have certified partners in place so you can work with third
    parties to set your CRM system up, or if they offer house onboarding
    seriously consider it, so you can get off to the right start.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember, customer support takes many forms, look for troubleshooting
    guides, certifications and training courses you and your team can take, user
    and expert forums and documentation available to help you work through any
    issues.
  </p>

  <h2>Top CRM Tips</h2>
  <p>Here’s a recap of our top tips:</p>
  <p>
    Identify your core needs first - Before exploring CRM options, define the
    problems you want to solve, such as improving lead management, automating
    tasks, or gaining better sales insights. This will help you solve problems
    and not create them!
  </p>
  <p>
    Usability over features - A CRM is only as effective as its user adoption.
    Choose a system that’s intuitive and easy for your team to use, even if it
    means sacrificing a few advanced features unless they’re absolutely
    essential.
  </p>
  <p>
    Check for integrations - Ensure the CRM integrates with your existing tools
    like email platforms, marketing tools etc. This will avoid the need for
    costly workarounds or migrations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Start small and scale up - Start with a CRM that meets your current needs
    and budget and has the potential to scale as your business grows. Look at
    pricing plans ahead of the monthly bill arriving.
