    <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
    <p>
        We care strongly about privacy.
        Our privacy policy for our own website is therefore simple: we store no identifiable information about visitors.
    </p>

    <h2 id="cookie">Cookies</h2>
    <p>
        In order to measure how many visitors our website has, we use a small analytics tool called <a href="https://usefathom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fathom</a>.
        Unlike most analytics tools in use, it stores no identifiable information, does not track you across sites, and sends no data to third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fathom is built to be GDPR-compliant, and the only cookie it stores is a flag stating whether or not you have visited the site before.
        This differs from most other analytics engines, which store a uniquely identifiable ID, allowing you to be tracked across the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
        We host our own version of Fathom, which means analytics data never leaves our own infrastructure.
        This means that you as a user don't have to worry about third parties building profiles based on your internet usage patterns.
    </p>
