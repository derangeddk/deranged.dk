- disables natural feedback loops, moves interaction to legal country
- encourages cheating: "we're doing what the contract obliges us to (and no more - even if your need is different from what we are delivering)"
- encourages big-bang deliveries by agreeing on set requirements and a deadline. Possible, but harder, to write contracts where parts are delivered little after little. (even worse: in public sector software in DK, a standard clause means that software taken into use is accepted as delivered, so small deliveries are impossible)
- overhead in cost due to legal back and forth, contractors must have a legal department that are paid to look over requirements specs and bids for contracts
- people are bad at scoping. if you write down what software you think you need, you are probably way off a good solution. especially if you do not have technical help. often better to define business needs and goals, and let technical people talk to you about how to get there, figure out a solution together. otherwise, non-programmers act as software architects. bad.
- levels of speccing: we want these concrete screens (illustrated) vs we want these concrete functions/buttons vs we want these features vs we want something that solves this problem vs we have these business priorities and needs and this budget
- sunk cost fallacy: once you're in a big bang project that isn't going well, human psychology will keep you in for much longer than would be good for you
