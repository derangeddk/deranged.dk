            Our development always starts with and is aligned with your business goals.

        <h2>We are a full-service dev team</h2>
        <div class="selling-point__text">
            <p>
                We have experience in a broad set of technologies, programming langauges and frameworks.
                We are most proficient as full-stack web developers, but have experts in infrastructure (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, etc.), application design (including microservice architectures), and UX.
            </p>
            <p>
                We train all employees to be quick at getting up to speed in new environments and code bases.
                We can probably help with your problem, no matter the tech stack&mdash;but you can always contact us to make sure.

        <h2>We can be your CTO</h2>
        <div class="selling-point__text">
            <p>
                Making the right technical decisions early in a company's life determines how well it can grow with demand.
                It is also often the difference between making it or not: establishing cash flow and showing value early are paramount.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have experience from a lot of different startups, and with starting several projects and making them sustainable.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can take the role as CTO in your company, aligning your development team with your business goals and concrete situation.
                Or we can support your CTO by providing context and data for decision making.

                The products of all the work we do for you, belongs to you.
                We will set it up so you can easily access the work we produce, and are always ready to hand over all work in progress if you request it.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you ever stop working with us, nothing of value will be lost, and you can get other developers to take over.

        <h2>We work well within a budget</h2>
        <div class="selling-point__text">
            <p>
                We know money is tight for early stage startups, but fortunately it doesn't have to cost a fortune to build software.
                By setting a monthly budget for software development work, your expenses become predictable, and a little can go a long way.
            </p>
            <p>
                We always look at our customers' concrete situation when working with them, and understand that cash flow may vary.
                We make sure to stay within your budget, and are happy to help you prioritize and plan budgets and software construction, so you can deliver value to customers or proof of concepts to investors.

        <h2>We start with your concrete situation</h2>
        <div class="selling-point__text">
            <p>
                We believe that communication&mdash;open, honest and human&mdash;is the best way to reach understanding.
                We will always start our software development from your concrete situation, listening to your business concerns and plans for the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is also why we don't do requirements specifications or big handovers&mdash;they always end up making context invisible.
                Business is changeable, and requirements change.
                We keep track with your current situation, so we can always give you the best technical advice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Concretely, we do this by regularly meeting with you, and talking about your situation, focusign on whatever pressing concerns may arise through conversation.

                We love helping businesses succeed, and feeling like we have a tangible impact.
                A great way to help a business succeed is to make it sustainable.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you choose to work with us, we will help you hire your own inhouse development team, once you are ready.
                We will help train them, ensure a good, constructive process for software development, and even offer to regularly mentor and guide employees if you are interested.
            </p>
            <p>
                In short, we don't just make it easy to get rid of us, when you are ready for the next step&mdash;we'll help you do it.
