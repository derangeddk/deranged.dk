            <p>
                We specialize in looking at your business needs, and helping you identify the fastest path towards solving your problems.
                We help incorporate both short and long term goals in the planning of software development, and always look at where software can have the biggest impact per expense.
            </p>
            <p>
                Concretely, we regularly meet with both your management and employees to ensure that we are building the right thing.
                We can take changes to your business domain into account as they happen.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your company is probably used to making decisions about company tools and which off-the-shelf products are used by your company.
                Building custom software is a different kind of beast&mdash;but don't worry, we can help with strategies and technical decisions related to this part of your company's technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will assist your existing CTO and work with them to make a strategy for custom software development that aligns with your business goals, and extends further than just the initial software we're building for you.

            <p>
                We train all employees to be quick at getting up to speed in new environments and code bases.

                We will help train them, ensure a good, constructive process for software development, and even offer to regularly mentor and guide employees if you are interested.
            </p>
