        <p>
            If you have a midsize business (50-250 employees) with an existing internal custom software system, but the system is hard to change, and sometimes seems more restrictive than enabling, we can help you with a constructive path onwards.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even if business is going well, a software system that is hard to change can be detrimental to your company's survival in the long term.
            As your business domain changes, your internal procedures (and therefore also your software system) needs to be able to respond, in order to keep your customers satisfied.
            A common sign of a restrictive system is that the system dictates how work is done in the company, rather than the other way around.
            Your employees are experts, and the system should support them.
        </p>
        <p>
            It can be hard to figure out how to move away from an existing system, especially if it seems that your entire business is tied up in the system.
            Fortunately, the move away can be done inexpensively and in small steps, never rendering your company without a working system.
            We can help you work out a plan.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is often expensive to build software on contract.
            This is largely due to the way requirements specifications are used, and how they limit rapid delivery of improvements, as well as feedback from the actual experts of the domain, your employees.
            (We have written a <a href="/klar-til-software/begraensende-system.pdf">short document in Danish on common pitfalls when moving away from existing systems</a>, that you may find interesting.)
        </p>
        <p>
            When you work with us, we do away with requirements specifications, because they are inefficient means to communicating actual business needs.
            Instead, we work with your management to figure out business goals, and with your employees to figure out concrete work practices and existing impediments to their work.
            With this knowledge in mind, we identify the biggest impact problem that we can solve the quickest, and start working towards a solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will help you build a good software culture, so you don't end up with a restrictive system again.
            With our approach, you spend a little money over more time, rather than large amounts of money every five to ten years.
            This ensures that you can respond to changes in your business domain, and that your employees are more likely to accept the new software that is delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you need it, we can even help you set up your own development department to continue our approach, once we have started it.
