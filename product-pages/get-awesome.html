        <p>
            If you have or are in the process of building your tech product, that you sell to customers, but need help getting it on the right path to market, we can help you.
        </p>
        <p>
            A startup's first product is a tricky thing, and it is often hard to figure out the best way to build a product that satisfies customers and investors.
            Especially setting the right team can be hard.
        </p>
        <p>
            We commonly hear of situations where a startup has hired a single or a few developers, but development has ended up taking longer and costing more than originally anticipated.
            The problem is that most people&mdash;even expert developers&mdash;have limitations, and are stronger at some facets of development than others.
            Having a single or a few developers take care of all development means that some work will take more time than if an expert of that particular field was doing it.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have specialized in setting a team of experts in everything needed to build a web based platform for a startup.
            At the same time, we have developers of varying degrees of expertice and related pay-grade.
            For every customer, we combine our developers in the most optimal way, so no hard thing takes too long, and the work than can be done by less experienced developers costs less.
        </p>
        <p>
            The end result is that we are faster and cheaper than most small teams or single developers.
        </p>
        <p>
            On top of that, we take into account your business goals, and help you plan for the quickest way to increase cash flow, be it through impressing investors or getting paying customers.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have experience taking over development of existing platforms, and using modern technologies (such as Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Logstash and Kibana) to make them stable, setting up monitoring, and putting them on the right track to deliver the business value the customer needs them to.

        <h2>We are a full-service dev team</h2>
        <div class="selling-point__text">
            <p>
                We have experience in a broad set of technologies, programming langauges and frameworks.
                We are most proficient as full-stack web developers, but have experts in infrastructure (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, etc.), application design (including microservice architectures), and UX.
            </p>
            <p>
                We train all employees to be quick at getting up to speed in new environments and code bases.
                We can probably help with your problem, no matter the tech stack&mdash;but you can always contact us to make sure.

        <div class="selling-point__text">
            <p>
                Making the right technical decisions early in a company's life determines how well it can grow with demand.
                It is also often the difference between making it or not: establishing cash flow and showing value early are paramount.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have experience from a lot of different startups, and with starting several projects and making them sustainable.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can take the role as CTO in your company, aligning your development team with your business goals and concrete situation.
                Or we can support your CTO by providing context and data for decision making.

                The products of all the work we do for you, belongs to you.

            </p>
            <p>
                If you ever stop working with us, nothing of value will be lost, and you can get other developers to take over.

        <div class="selling-point__text">
            <p>
                We know money is tight for early stage startups, but fortunately it doesn't have to cost a fortune to build software.
                By setting a monthly budget for software development work, your expenses become predictable, and a little can go a long way.
            </p>
            <p>
                We always look at our customers' concrete situation when working with them, and understand that cash flow may vary.
                We make sure to stay within your budget, and are happy to help you prioritize and plan budgets and software construction, so you can deliver value to customers or proof of concepts to investors.

        <div class="selling-point__text">
            <p>
                We believe that communication&mdash;open, honest and human&mdash;is the best way to reach understanding.
                We will always start our software development from your concrete situation, listening to your business concerns and plans for the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is also why we don't do requirements specifications or big handovers&mdash;they always end up making context invisible.
                Business is changeable, and requirements change.
                We keep track with your current situation, so we can always give you the best technical advice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Concretely, we do this by regularly meeting with you, and talking about your situation, focusign on whatever pressing concerns may arise through conversation.

                We love helping businesses succeed, and feeling like we have a tangible impact.
                A great way to help a business succeed is to make it sustainable.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you choose to work with us, we will help you hire your own inhouse development team, once you are ready.
                We will help train them, ensure a good, constructive process for software development, and even offer to regularly mentor and guide employees if you are interested.
            </p>
            <p>
                In short, we don't just make it easy to get rid of us, when you are ready for the next step&mdash;we'll help you do it.
