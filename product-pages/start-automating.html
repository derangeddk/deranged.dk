        <p>
            If you have a mid-size business (50-250 employees), and business is going well, but custom software could improve your business' inner workings, we can help you make the right technical decisions, to ensure your custom software remains flexible and responsive to changes in your business domain.
        </p>
        <p>
            We specialize in helping businesses that have reached the point where off-the-shelf software is no longer solving all their problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your employees are spending a lot of time on boring, routine tasks, with no readymade product available to help, it's time to build custom software for your company.
            Unfortunately, there are a lot of pitfalls when doing this, and software often ends up being expensive and needlessly restrictive (we have written a <a href="/klar-til-software/automatisering-af-processer.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short document in Danish about some common issues</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            If custom software works, it helps free up your employees' time for important work; and it changes with your business even as requirements in your business domain changes.
            A common process for building custom software is using requirements specifications to ensure precise delivery of features, but this process has the negative effect of making the software development process rigid, and is often connected to slow deliveries of working software, often resulting in software that doesn't fit an ever changeable business context.
        </p>
        <p>
            We try to solve these problems with our approach to building custom software for midsize businesses.
            We build an inhouse team that works closely with you management and employees to ensure alignment with business goals and concrete work processes, as well as employee buy-in for new software.
            We don't use requirements specifications.
        </p>
        <p>
            We work in quick increments, delivering small bits of value to your business quickly.
            We always focus on the biggest (most costly) problem, and fix that first.
            By constantly working with your employees, and making sure our software solves real problems, and modifying solutions until they fit their work, we end up with better solutions than could have been described in a requirements specification.
