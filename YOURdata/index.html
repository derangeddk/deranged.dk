        It has never been easier to get access to advanced tools, to integrate
        third-party tools with your applications to enhance the user experience,
        and to help you gather vital information.
        Unfortunately, this ease-of-use has come largely at the cost of your
        control over your and your users' data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not only can you not know what the data, that is generated by users'
        interaction with your company, is used for; several services are known
        to base their business model directly on collecting information on your
        users, aggregating it, building profiles, and using it to market content
        more directly to them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most distressingly, data that crosses the border to the US can be read
        by the US government in some circumstances, posing a significant privacy
        threat to your user.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your application is a liability for your users.
    </p>
    <p>
        It doesn't have to be this way.
        We're here to help.
    </p>

    <h1>Reclaiming your data</h1>
    <p>
        Most companies depend heavily on third party applications because it is
        <em>easy</em>.
        Any potential replacement for existing services must be just as easy
        to integrate with and use.
    </p>
    <p>
        The YOURdata initiative strives to build and support open source
        alternatives to established and popular services used by many websites,
        and to build them in such a way that you can spin up your own
        production-ready instance and integrate with it, as quickly as you would
        sign up for and integrate with alternatives where you are not in control
        of what happens to your and your users' data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are a few guiding principles for the projects we are building:
        <ul>
            <li>
                You can spin up your own instance of the project in minutes.
                In fact, it should preferably take a single command to start it
                in production using a popular cloud provider.
            </li>
            <li>
                The project tracks as little as possible.
                Some data is neccessary to support the operation of the service,
                but it will deliberately track as little as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                The projects run independently, with their own data stores, in
                order to discourage needless correlation and aggregation of data.
            </li>
            <li>
                You, the developer running the service, are in control of the
                rules and policies the projects offer, and can change the visual
                appearance.
            </li>
            <li>
                And of course the service is open-source licensed, so you can
                use it however you please. This includes forking it, if you
                disagree with design decisions, or want to add your own tweaks.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        With these rules in mind, we are building services much like the open
        source projects you know and love, but at a slightly higher level of
        abstraction: entire applications that can work as services in your software
        system, fully and adequately encapsulating functionality.
        You won't have to reinvent the same system for different contexts.

    <h1>List of projects</h1>
    <p>
        The following projects are recommended as projects that live up to the principles
        of the YOURdata initiative.
        These are projects we take try to take a role in supporting, but they have not
        necessarily originated with us.
    </p>
    <p>
        Projects start as concepts, then move into alpha, beta, and finally release
        stages.
    </p>

<div class="project-container">
    <div class="project">
        <h3>Fathom (beta)</h3>
        <p>
            Fathom is a GDPR-aware analytics engine.
            It helps you keep track of user visits and behavior on your website&mdash;without handing data on
            to a third party.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project was started by two independent software developers, Danny and Paul, who
            <a href="https://usefathom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offer hosting services</a> in
            case you don't want to set up your own instance.
        </p>
        <p>
            An alternative to Google Analytics, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a class="gh-link" href="https://github.com/usefathom/fathom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>hype (alpha)</h3>
        <p>
            hype helps you manage mailing lists and write newsletters.
            Let users sign up to news about your product or offerings, without passing all that information
            on to someone else.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project is currently in alpha, which means you can run it, but the feature set is very limited.
        </p>
        <p>
            An alternative to Mailchimp, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a class="gh-link" href="https://github.com/derangeddk/hype" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>chattie (concept)</h3>
        <p>
            Run your own chat-like interface with customers, allowing quick and informal communication.
            The goal of chattie is to construct a base level application that can be extended with
            any capabilities that may be needed, for example machine learning and other popular chat
            bot features.
        </p>
        <p>
            An alternative to Intercom or even products like Facebook Messenger and Google Allo.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>ident (concept)</h3>
        <p>
            An identity service that does all the boring things you might want in a user system.
            The service will be easy to integrate with applications in several ways, including
            through an API or through quicker libraries that talk directly to a database, hopefully
            making for a service so fast that you will never need to write a user system again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, the project is being incepted as
            <a href="https://github.com/derangeddk/hype/tree/master/src/ident" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a part of hype</a>,
            pending future extraction.
        </p>
        <p>
            A fully working alternative (although not quite with the same plans for integration) is
            Netlify's <a href="https://github.com/netlify/gotrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gotrue</a>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>payment (concept)</h3>
        <p>
            A highly configurable service that allows you to take payment for orders, manage incoming orders,
            and send receipts by the click of a button.
            The goal is to support integration with various payment providers, making it quick and easy for a
            business to change which one they use, without it impacting any other part of the application.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, a prototype is running in the Mærkelex project as
            <a href="https://github.com/hypesystem/maerkelex-payment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maerkelex-payment</a>,
            pending future extraction.
        </p>
        <p>
            A fully working alternative (although not quite with the same plans for integration) is
            Netlify's <a href="https://github.com/netlify/gocommerce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gocommerce</a>.
        </p>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>comments (concept)</h3>
        <p>
            Allow users to comment on content you host.
        </p>
        <p>
            An alternative to Discus, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            A fully working alternative (although not quite with the same plans for integration) is
            Netlify's <a href="https://github.com/netlify/gotell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gotell</a>.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="project">
        <h3>groups (concept)</h3>
        <p>
            Communities should own the platforms they interact on.
            This project should result in a basic group interaction experience, where users can share relevant
            information with each other, create and manage events by the community, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            An alternative to Facebook Groups, Podio, etc.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>ticketeer (concept)</h3>
        <p>
            This project allows any community to sell tickets for events.
            It builds on top of <em>payment</em> to provide reservation of tickets until purchase is completed, queueing, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            This service may be combined with <em>groups</em> to allow groups to sell tickets for their events.
        </p>
        <p>
            An alternative to Ticketmaster, etc.

    <h1>Honorable mentions</h1>
    <p>
        There are projects which live up to the principles stated on this page, but
        which we are not taking a role in supporting and developing (usually because
        of slightly differing visions, which lead us to developing and supporting
        alternatives).
    </p>
    <p>
        Nonetheless, these projects deserve mention, as they might be what you need in
        order to reclaim control of your data.
