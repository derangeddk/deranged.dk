      <h2>How we do it? What we do?</h2>
      - proxy with pseudonomization, servers hosted in the EU, operated by EU companies all the way down
      -  advanced spoofing to keep device differences, bucketing of data. *currently in beta, and quality of grouping will improve over time, but much better than competitors
      - in the future: custom config for user data in custom events, urls, etc. we'll help you identify and optimize, ask you whether certain ID-looking things in urls and data sent are user data, in which case we will strip them out. We try to auto-detect and remove more rather than less, but auto-detected data will be reported to you so you can disable the removal
      - in the future we will support easy one-click migration without having to change anything on your site. you will pay only hosting costs. To new GA4 or to Matomo (recommended: keeps your history, can do cookie-less, can get utm and referrer and no data loss for future)
