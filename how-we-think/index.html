        It has never been easier to get access to advanced tools, to integrate
        third-party tools with your applications to enhance the user experience,
        and to help you gather vital information.
        Unfortunately, this ease-of-use has come largely at the cost of your
        control over your and your users' data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not only can you not know what the data, that is generated by users'
        interaction with your company, is used for; several services are known
        to base their business model directly on collecting information on your
        users, aggregating it, building profiles, and using it to market content
        more directly to them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most distressingly, data that crosses the border to the US can be read
        by the US government in some circumstances, posing a significant privacy
        threat to your user.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your application is a liability for your users.
    </p>
    <p>
        It doesn't have to be this way.
        We're here to help.
    </p>

    <h1>Reclaiming your data</h1>
    <p>
        We depend heavily on third party applications because it is <em>easy</em>.
        Any potential replacement for existing services must be just as easy
        to integrate with and use.
    </p>
    <p>
        The YOURdata initiative strives to build open source alternatives to
        established and popular services used by many websites, and to build
        them in such a way that you can spin up your own production-ready
        instance and integrate with it, as quickly as you would sign up for
        and integrate with the existing services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are a few guiding principles for the projects we are building:
        <ul>
            <li>
                You can spin up your own instance of the project in minutes.
                In fact, it should preferably take a single command to start it
                in production using a popular cloud provider.
            </li>
            <li>
                The project tracks as little as possible.
                Some data is neccessary to support the operation of the service,
                but it will deliberately track as little as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                The projects run independently, with their own data stores, in
                order to discourage needless correlation and aggregation of data.
            </li>
            <li>
                You, the developer running the service, are in control of the
                rules and policies the projects offer, and can change the visual
                appearance.
            </li>
            <li>
                And of course the service is open-source licensed, so you can
                use it however you please. This includes forking it, if you
                disagree with design decisions, or want to add your own tweaks.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        With these rules in mind, we should be able to provide something much like
        your favourite open source projects, but at a slightly higher level of
        abstraction: entire applications that can work as services in your software
        system, fully and adequately encapsulating functionality.
        You won't have to reinvent the same system for different contexts.

    <h1>List of projects</h1>
    <p>The following projects are part of the YOURdata initiative.</p>
    <p>
        Projects start as concepts, then move into alpha, beta, and finaly release
        stages.
    </p>

    <h2>hype (concept)</h2>
    <p>
        Build mailing lists for topics, manage lists, send mails in your well-defined
        templates, writing them in markdown.
    </p>
    <p>
        An alternative to Mailchimp, etc.
    </p>

    <h2>comments (concept)</h2>
    <p>
        Allow comments for topics, set up rules for moderation, and manage them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alternative to Disqus, etc.
    </p>

    <h2>analytics (concept)</h2>
    <p>
        Collect usage data of your application without tracking users (user-identifiable
        info) or leaking the data to companies that use it for profiling of users.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alternative to Google Analytics. Let's be honest, there aren't really any other
        options.
