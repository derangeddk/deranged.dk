intro: >
We know it’s difficult to find software developers you can trust. From our own experiences working for other software companies and from our experiences within deranged, we realise that the world of software is difficult to understand and that it can feel like an uphill struggle when you have to have software developed for you. In order to make the process of finding the right developer a bit easier we’ve collected our top tips for finding a good developer. These are guidelines that we also follow as developers.

    <h2>Speak directly to the developer</h2>
    <p>
One of the most important things when you’re trying to find a software developer is speaking directly to the developer. It might seem obvious and like a given, but for a lot of the bigger software companies you meet with a project manager and never actually get in touch with the developer. It can sometimes be useful to have a project manager on board, but the most essential person to talk to is the software developer. They’re going to be the person actually working on your project and they’re the one who needs to understand the project fully. “When I was working at a big company as a software developer, I was asked to work on certain project, but I was never part of the decision making part of the process, despite the fact that I was the one who was going to be building it. Everything went through another person, so I had no direct contact with the client. That meant that sometimes things got lost in translation, or I wasn’t actually sure why I was building something,” explains Anders, one of the senior software developers at deranged. 
    </p>
    <p>
    When you’re not in direct contact with the software developer, you’re also missing out on all the technical know-how. If you’re not a software developer, it can be very difficult to know what is and isn’t technically possible. The software developer can quickly tell you what your options are where as a project leader might not immediately know, which means there might be more back and forth between you and them. All of that adds up cost-wise. Another important element to meeting directly with the developer is that you really want the developer to understand your business. Unless you’re fortunate enough to have a background in software, it’s very difficult to know exactly what your needs are and how particular software can be beneficial to your business. A good software developer should want to understand your business, understand what your needs are and from that be able to suggest what software you actually need. 
</p>
<p>
At deranged, we’ve taken this approach. Firstly, we don’t have anyone working with clients who doesn’t have a background in software development. Secondly, we make it clear to our clients that we want to understand their business. We want to act like an in-house team of developers do, because we believe that it’s the best way of creating software that actually works for the client. Lots of us have worked in places where the client told us what they wanted and then it was built, but we also quickly realised that what was built wasn’t actually what was needed, and so the client ends up wasting money on something they didn’t really need. The software world is sometimes pretty stuck in its ways and for many companies it isn’t the norm for the software developers to speak to the client, but the benefits from that direct communication are incredibly important to ensure that you as a client get the best solution your money can buy.  
</p>
    <h2>Don’t fill out a detailed requirement specification</h2>
    <p>
When you get in touch with software companies, quite a lot of them, and especially the bigger ones, will ask you to feel in a requirement specification. A requirement specification is a document where you, funnily enough, specify your requirements for the software you want built. These often require a high level of detail, and once you’ve specified something it can be hard to get it changed. This is a pretty daunting task if you’ve never worked with software before and you aren’t actually sure what you need. Software developers are the people who are actually able to fill out a requirement specification, and even they can’t predict everything needed to get a project done right at the beginning. If a company is asking you to provide a requirement specification, alarms bells should start ringing. 
    </p>
    <p>
Software is a very fluid process. Software isn’t a one-size-fits-all and things don’t always go to plan, which also means it’s pretty impossible to predict everything that’s needed in the process of building it. Having to specify every software build prior to starting is impossible and impractical. Of course, it’s important to have an understanding of what needs to be done before starting on a project. As mentioned before, it’s important to have a good conversation with your software developer and make sure that they understand your business and the needs you have. That takes a little bit of time and a wish from you to provide that information and for the software developer to ask questions. Always start with a conversation before you fill out any documentation. The software developer should be taking on the role as the expert, because that’s exactly what they are. They should be helping you with the software solutions you need based on the information you give them about your company. From the beginning it’s a collaborative process. 
    </p>
   <h2> Make sure you own the code that’s created for you </h2>
   <p>
A lot of companies have encountered this problem over the years. Owning the code you’ve paid for might seem like the most obvious process, but interestingly, the opposite frequently happens. When a software development company writes code for their clients and it isn’t specified that the code, once the project is completed, is going to be owned by the client, then the software company actually owns it. This might not seem like a big deal, but if you don’t own your own code, then you’re stuck with the same software development company. You don’t have the freedom to go out and find other partners to work with, and if something needs changing or upgrading, you usually end up paying a premium for it.

“We had a client once who came to us after having worked with another software company. They had had software built for them, but when it needed to be upgraded a year later, they ended up paying the same amount again. All-in-all they paid about 300,000 DKK for something that should’ve cost about 100,000 DKK. Because they were stuck with a monopoly, they didn’t have a way out. And the only way out was to rebuild their whole system, because they couldn’t get their code from the original developers. It can be a very expensive mistake,” explains Niels, senior software developer at deranged.
    </p>
    <p>
    It’s a top tip to make sure you own your code. If a development company refuses to allow it, then find someone else. Write it into the contract and make sure you give yourself the freedom later and that you don’t get stuck with the same developers or having to pay an extortionate fee for getting your software released.

    <h2>Get an estimate</h2>
    <p>
Like many other things in life, software is unpredictable in its nature. Every piece of software is unique, and with anything unique comes its own set of challenges along the way. That also means that it’s impossible to estimate exactly how much a piece of software is going to cost at the beginning of a project. If you’re given a set price, you might end up paying too much for your software or not be able to get everything you wanted because the money runs out – or simply a subpar product. 
    </p>
    <p>
What you want instead of a set price is an estimate of the price. An estimate is a much more honest way to talk about money when it comes to software development. At deranged, we’ve decided that the fairest way to give an estimate to our clients is by providing them with three different ones: good case scenario, normal case scenario and bad case scenario. That way we’ve given a range of what it might cost to get a certain piece of software built including unforeseen bumps along the way. Even the most experienced software developer will not be able to foresee all the obstacles there might be, but by making sure there’s space in the budget for those things and then only billing for actual hours used, you’re sure not to be overpaying for a product. 
    </p>
    <p>
It’s also always a good idea to have a conversation about what the developer is going to do about any unforeseen issues and how that will impact the budget. Having that conversation also creates a higher level of trust with the developer as you know you can rely on them to not overspend and that you don’t need to be accepting every budget change because you’ve agreed on a specific range, and if it looks like it’s going to be more expensive then the developer will run it past you. It becomes a better partnership when the budget is openly discussed and there’s an estimate, rather than a set price, at the core of the partnership.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Get the project delivered piece by piece</h2>
    <p>
    When you work with a software development partner it’s important that your whole project doesn’t get delivered in one stage. It’s kind of the old-school way of doing it where you’ve given someone a task and then you get to see that task once it’s completed. As mentioned before software is a fluid process and to get the best software for your needs you need to have a partnership with your developer. It’s a continuous process, so you should also be able to see what is being produced during the process. No, there are not going to be daily updates because software takes some time to build, but throughout the process there should be launches, so you can see how the software is working for you and whether or not something needs to change. 
</p>
<p>
Software is a lot of trialing and testing and as the person who will inevitably end up using it and working with it, you’re the perfect person for testing. Small launches along the way means you can catch problems before they get too big or something is built on top of it which means you can no longer change it without a huge cost. You really want to see the software that’s being created for you throughout the building process. 
</p>
<p>
The continuous conversation with your developers also means that you have a good understanding of what they’re doing and why and vice versa, and can learn about the software that is being built for you.

    <strong>Finding the right partner</strong>
    <p>
The world of software is quite a daunting one to have to enter, especially if you’ve never had anything to do with it before. By taking note of the five points above and finding a development company that aligns with those needs, you’ve set yourself up for success. Find yourself a software developer that asks you the right questions, meets directly with you, doesn’t require a detailed requirement analysis, but instead helps you figure out your needs, makes sure you own the code when they’re done, gives an estimate and delivers in chunks. None of these things are too much to ask, and it’s never worth compromising on them.
